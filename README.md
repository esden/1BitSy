This project includes 1BitSy evaluation boards. These boards are breadboard friendly STM32 (eventually other MCUs will be considered) with exposed Cortex JTAG and SWD interfaces. This allows the use of the Black Magic Probe, instead of the usually very limited built in debugger hardware.

Currently we have the following eval boards:

* 1BitSy V1.0a -> STM32F415RGT6
